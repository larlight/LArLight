  /**
     \class preco_algo_base
     The base class of pulse reconstruction algorithms. All algorithms should inherit from this calss
     to be executed by a manager class, pulse_reco. Note that this class does not depend on the rest
     of the framework except for the use of constants. In order to reconstruct a pulse, all it requires
     is a std::vector<unsigned short> type object (i.e. raw waveform), waveform pedestal, and its standard
     deviation. All of these are to be provided by an executer. Reconstructed pulse parameters are
     stored in the pulse_param struct object.

     All methods specified as "virtual" should be implemented by the inherit children class.

     This class provides some basic std::vector calculation algorithms such as integral, derivative,
     max and min algorithms. Inherit children classes are encouraged to use these provided methods
     when possible.
