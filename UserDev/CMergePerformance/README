The purpose of this package is to quantify how well cluster merging algorithms do.

It will:
   1) Read in fuzzycluster and MCShower objects
   2) Match the clusters with their respective MCShowers
   3) Perform whatever cluster merging algorithms the user wants
   4) Create figure-of-merit plots to show merging performance
