Try:

# Add my test routine #
#                     #
#######################

Write your routine source code with ".cc" extension.
Then add your source code name without ".cc" extension to the 
PROGRAMS variable in GNUmakefile. The makefile in this directory
will compile all codes defined in PROGRAMS variable.

After that, simply try:

> make

Try to solve all compiler warnings before comitting :)

Currently available:

(*) simple_io.cc 

    Creates event_waveform class instance, add it to a TTree, and
    write into an output file. Then it retrieves this written TTree
    by opening the writen output file, and retrieves the written 
    event_waveform class instance. It's adumb I/O test to make sure
    class object I/O is handled correctly over ROOT streamer.

(*) simple_loop.cc

    A storage_manager class test routine. It performs a simple
    example event loop using dat/sample.root file. You may take
    this routine as an example event-loop method to perform your
    analysis. HOWEVER, try to use Analysis package instead especially
    if you want this analysis code to be portable. "Portable" means
    to share your analysis code with someone. For details, read 
    Analysis/README.
