# How to include & compile in local LArSoft? #

Obviously you do not want to build all packages in this repository.
Packages to be built should be defined through shell env. variable:

> export LAR_MODULE="DataScanner Example"
> source $MAKE_TOP_DIR/config/setup.sh

As shown above, if you wish to include multiple packages for
compilation, separate them by a space.
The $MAKE_TOP_DIR/config/setup.sh script uses your LAR_MODULE
environment variable to create relevant symbolic links under $SRT_LOCAL.
Before doing so, it also cleans up pre-existing symbolic links not to
mix with older configuration.
