(*) test_simple_io ... You can use this executable to run a simple I/O test.
    		       This routine first writes out a sample LArLight data
		       file with all kinds of event-wise data containers.
		       After that, it attempts to read what was written on
		       the root file. When doing this, it compares number
		       of events written per data type vs. number of events
		       read to make sure all went OK. Here's usage:

    > test_simple_io



(*) simple_write ... You can use this executable to create a LArLight root 
    		     file with 100 events containing larlight::DATA::Track 
		     object. The output file name is trial.root. Here's how
		     to run it.

    > simple_write

(*) simple_read ... You can use this executable to read what you created in 
    		    simple_write. Here is how to run it (assuming you have
		    "trial.root" file).

    > simple_read trial.root
